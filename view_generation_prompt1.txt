You have Looker MCP tools. Create view files for ALL tables mentioned in the Field DSL.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Identify all unique tables from the Field DSL (look for table:"xxx")
2. Create ONE view file per table
3. All SQL must be BigQuery syntax
4. Infer measure types from field names (lat/long=average, amounts=sum, counts=sum)

Looker Project: tableau_looker_team_test

Connection Info:
- Project: tableau-to-looker-migration
- Dataset: Tableau_To_BigQuery

Field DSL: See uploaded file

Transformation Examples:

DSL: facility_name|table:"closestoffices"|db:"FacilityName"|string
LookML:
dimension: facility_name {
  type: string
  sql: ${TABLE}.FacilityName ;;
}

DSL: latitude|table:"closestoffices"|db:"Latitude"|number
LookML:
measure: latitude {
  type: average
  sql: ${TABLE}.Latitude ;;
}

DSL: mature_de_novo|string|formula:IF mature = 1 THEN "Mature" ELSE "De Novo" END
LookML:
dimension: mature_de_novo {
  type: string
  sql: CASE WHEN ${mature} = 1 THEN "Mature" ELSE "De Novo" END ;;
}

DSL: facility_code_name|string|formula:facilityname + " - " + facilitycode
LookML:
dimension: facility_code_name {
  type: string
  sql: CONCAT(${facilityname}, ' - ', ${facilitycode}) ;;
}

BigQuery Formula Conversions:
- String concat: + → CONCAT()
- Conditionals: IF...THEN...ELSE...END → CASE WHEN...THEN...ELSE...END
- Date add: DATEADD('day', n, date) → DATE_ADD(date, INTERVAL n DAY)
- Date parts: YEAR(date) → EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date)
- To string: STR(x) → CAST(x AS STRING)
- Field refs: fieldname → ${fieldname}

---

Naming Convention:
- View files: views/{table_name}.view.lkml (use exact table name from DSL)
- sql_table_name: `tableau-to-looker-migration.Tableau_To_BigQuery.{table_name}`

Example:
For table "closestoffices":
- File: views/closestoffices.view.lkml
- sql_table_name: `tableau-to-looker-migration.Tableau_To_BigQuery.closestoffices`

Steps:
1. Call dev_mode(true)
2. Call get_projects() to get project_id (should be "tableau_looker_team_test")
3. Read the uploaded Field DSL file
4. Scan Field DSL to identify all unique table names
5. For EACH table:
   - Filter fields where table:"{table_name}"
   - Generate view structure
   - Call create_project_file(project_id, "views/{table_name}.view.lkml", content) if does not exists
   - if exists call update_project_file (project_id, "views/{table_name}.view.lkml", content) append the details
6. Confirm all view files created with their paths

Expected Output:
- views/closestoffices.view.lkml
- views/dim_location.view.lkml
